Hi, my name is PJ Voatt. I've got a new show called Search Engine. Each week I try to answer a question I have about the world. No question too big, no question too small. This is a preview of one of our first episodes, one that turned into a real roller coaster, where we answer the question, is it true you should never, under any circumstances, drink the coffee on airplanes? Alright, here we go. Sixth Floor In March, I went to visit a friend at his apartment in New York. A former roommate who actually over the years has had a lot of success on TV. His name's Anthony, as in Anthony Parowski. You may have seen him on the Netflix show Queer Eye. He's also the author of two best-selling cookbooks, and honestly, just a great host. Coal brew, nitro, or espresso, like latte situation. Anthony and I have actually been friends for a long time. Way before he had a TV show, way before I had a podcast. We go back, this feels crazy to say, almost 20 years. How do we know each other? We know each other. Well, originally we took acting classes together in Montreal, when you studied at McGill and I studied at Concordia. And then when I moved to New York and I needed an apartment, because I moved here for school, you had a place in Clinton Hill with a roommate, and you had a spare bedroom and a condo, and I moved in with you sight unseen. We had some good years. We did have some good years. Okay, so we're not here to talk about good years. We were flying together, and you said something that haunted me more than I expected it to. Do you remember this? Yes, I remember exactly. You said, under no circumstances should someone drink the coffee on an airplane, or the water provided on an airplane. Yes, okay, so it started out, you should never wash your hands in the bathroom of an airplane. Because I haven't been doing that anyway. Oh, great. We'll take that on at a later time. So my father told me, my dad's an ER physician, and he told me that he would get cases of people who would get like pink eye or some kind of an eye infection, or a stye infection, and he loves to like research and like get down to like the root cause of things, and he would learn that a lot of these people would take flights. So I started paying attention, and then I noticed that when pilots use the bathroom, they bring in a bottle of water with them, or like a thermosy situation. Wait, you independently noticed that? Yes, I noticed that myself on Delta flights in particular. I would never, okay, so you noticed pilots walking into the bathroom holding bottles of water? I noticed it twice. That's still like enough to make a valid assumption, right? So it started out that way. And your assumption is the reason they're bringing the bottle of water, it's not because they want to like rehydrate while they pee or whatever, it's that they're washing their hands with the bottle of water. Correct. And then I was on a really early morning flight one day, and there was a sassy flight attendant, and she just seemed like she didn't give two shits, and she asked if we wanted like coffee or tea or anything, and then I was like, okay, I need you to be honest with me. How do you feel about the water? Like I really want coffee, but how do you feel about the coffee on a plane? And then she looked at me and she said something along the lines of, I don't care how much I need coffee, I would never drink that. And then I kind of like started asking around, and then I learned that the same water is used to create the coffee and the tea that is used to wash your hands in the bathroom. And so is the problem, what is the theory that just like they're not cleaning the container that the water is in? I mean, it's not that they're serving people hand wash, back wash coffee, like that's not the problem. No, no, no, no, no, no, but it all comes from the same tank, and herein lies the issue, and I have no proof of this, this is only like rumors that I've heard, but I'm running with it. Apparently they only have to legally wash the tank once or twice a year. That's disgusting. So when you're on a plane and you're watching like people just like sip their coffee or whatever, are you just like, ugh? I judge it and I worry for their safety, and then I'm just so excited because I always bring two Yetis with me. I bring one, I go to a Starbucks and I order ahead so that I have plenty amount of coffee, because I love drinking coffee, and then the second one I fill up with water after I pass TSA so that I'm able to be hydrated and I don't have to ask for a million little plastic water bottles. One of the benefits of our friendship is like you're so thoughtful about existing in the world, and I kind of drag my body around like it's like a meat balloon that got attached to my leg while I'm like looking at my phone, and so I feel like I've benefited from hanging out with you and you're like, hey, there's like a nicer way to exist if you'd like to. But I would never remember to bring like two Yetis to the airport. That wouldn't happen for me. I would buy it. Here's what will happen. We'll have this conversation. I'll buy a Yeti on the internet because it's cool, and then I'll like procrastinate opening the package when it comes to my house, and then I'll open it and then I'll lose it three days later. Lucky for you, you're at my apartment right now, so when you leave, you're going to leave with two new Yetis, and one of them has a little spout for hot beverages, so it doesn't like pour onto your mouth, and the other one is great for water where it has a bigger mouth. I don't deserve to have friends. So just to explain this moment a little bit, Anthony, one part of his personality is just that he recommends a lot of products. Like professionally, yes, he has deals with brands, but I mean even before that was his job, well before he was famous, he's just always been a person who's very evangelical about recommending things he likes, whether or not anyone's paying him to do that. If he finds a good sunscreen, I'll hear about it. A good pierogi place, a new recipe, certain kinds of deodorant. Anthony's life is a never-ending quest to make things just a little bit better. And that was maybe part of what was under this question, airline travel, famously immune to improvement. He wanted to know when it came at least to the disgusting water, A, was this rumor true, but B, if it was true, were some airlines doing better than others? It would be nice to know, do different airlines have different laws for how often they have to clean the tank and where does the water come from? Like the major ones, American, Delta, United, but Delta's my favorite airline, so I'd be very curious to see if there's any difference. It had not occurred to me, but it seemed natural to Anthony, that you might pay attention to how well an airline took care of the noticeable details as a sort of proxy for understanding how well they did everything else. Well, I'm not going to name the airline, but you remember the airline that we flew to Seattle. That wasn't a great one. There were no TVs. The chairs were like, it was an old plane because I'm still terrified of flying. You're still terrified of flying? Absolutely. I have started looking at the type of airplane and seeing the way the seating is set up. I like to have a space between me and the window because I feel like if a window cracks open, it has happened. The whole body gets sucked out, all the bones crush, then I feel like I'm safer in the middle and I feel more coddled in a good way. Wait, hold on. No, no, no, no, no, but anyway, that's crazy. I was reading something online the other day where somebody was like, I don't understand why, it was some economist nerd, and they were like, I don't get why they don't charge less for middle seats since no one would ever want a middle seat. You are the target market for a middle seat just in case the window cracks open so the person next to you gets sucked out of the window before you. Correct, but my point is, I'm coming back, there must be some kind of a thing, like the way you can see the seating chart based on the year of the plane so you can see what the seating layout is like. I wonder if you could also see where the water tanks are to see if the one in the bathroom is separate from the one that's being used for the coffee and the tea. And there must be guidelines and regulations available. I feel like everything is available on the internet. I have three flights coming up in the next week, and I will ask every single flight attendant and anybody I can, including the person at the check-in window if they know this information, because I want to get to the bottom of it too. This question would take me on a very strange investigation. From a mysterious chain of TikTok videos to a horrifying science experiment conducted by a child prodigy to the end, where we find the answer to our question. I hope I do not sound too much like a TV news anchor if I promise that the answer may surprise you.

This particular episode is called, Wait, You Shouldn't Drink the Coffee on Airplanes?"}, "podcast_summary": "In a recent episode of the podcast \"Search Engine,\" host PJ Voatt explores whether it is true that one should never drink the coffee on airplanes. PJ's investigation begins when a friend, Anthony Parowski, warns him about the potential hazards of consuming coffee and water on flights. PJ consults his father, an ER physician, who confirms that infections can indeed occur due to contaminated water. PJ also notices pilots bringing their own water into airplane bathrooms. Further research reveals that the same water is used to make coffee and tea and to wash hands. Allegedly, airlines are only required to clean the water tank once or twice a year. To ensure his own safety, PJ now brings his own coffee and water on flights using insulated containers. PJ and Anthony discuss the varying quality of different airlines and the idea that the state of certain aspects of airline service may be indicative of overall airline care. The episode concludes on a cliffhanger, promising a surprising answer to the question.
